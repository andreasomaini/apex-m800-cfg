# apex-m800-cfg

Configure SteelSeries Apex M800 Keyboard on Linux (Maybe other keyboards too)

## Current Status

As of now, this utility lets you "upload" configuration sniffed from the original [SteelSeries Engine](https://steelseries.com/engine).
This means that you still need a Windows/Mac computer in order to create a configuration. (More below)

However, once you have created the desired configurationsfrom Windows/Mac and cloned them
into some binary format (more below), you can apply the configuration directly from Linux whenever you want.
